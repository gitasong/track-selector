# Track Selector

#### Independent project in HTML5/JS/JQuery to assist Epicodus prospective students in deciding on a programming track.

#### By Nicole Freed

## Description

Independent project for Epicodus Week 2. Helps a prospective student at Epicodus decide which programming track to enroll in via an HTML/Bootstrap form asking them about their preferences. Implements Javascript branching and JQuery behaviors to show/hide relevant portions of the content, and to provide the user with their top track choices and ideal track choice at the end.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* In the Mac Terminal, clone the GitHub repository to your desktop using the command <git clone URL>, where URL is the actual URL of this GitHub repository.
* Double-click on the downloaded file to unzip it.
* Double-click on track-selector.html to load it into your browser of choice.
* Fill out the form following the instructions in the web page you just loaded.
* Click the "Show me my results!" button to see your track suggestions.


## Known Bugs

* If "Show me my results!" button is pressed multiple times in succession with different choices each time, it may append the newer results to the older.
* First Name field data is not validated, and no default personalization will occur if it is not filled in.
